1. Add in MongoDbClient::command()...this appears to be the easiest way to
   do sort().skip().limit()...(also seems to be the only way to get the 
   new automatically generated _id(), if we need it...)

[Caught JDA::MongoDbClient::Exception during MongoDbClient::command(): "Cursor Failure: "find command not yet implemented"]
[https://jira.mongodb.org/browse/CSHARP-1502: You are using version 3.0.7 of the server. The find command was not introduced until server version 3.2.0. You'll need to upgrade your server in order to use the find command.]

Looks like the find() command is now supported in mongoc!

* Add In Unit Tests via "gtest"...

Extra Credit:
1. use log4cxx rather than JDA::Logger...?
