[ ]: Add denormalization right after processing each form...
[ ]: Resume processing of items from 1Q 2015 index...
---------------------
[x] * daemon: denormalize dn_xxx fields at top level of "form" document...
[ ] * daemon: extra credit: perhaps as we denormalize, we can also standardize the telephone number
	  such that if it consists of 10 digits with no punctuation, we can insert dashes like this: ddd-ddd-dddd
      For example, here are the phone's from 
				"accession_number" : "0001127602-16-035587",
				"dn_company_business_address_business_phone" : "5084782000",

				"accession_number" : "9999999997-16-022382",
				"dn_company_business_address_business_phone" : "626-793-7717"
      wouldn't it be nice if they were standardized with dashes?  Maybe we can do this
      standardization later after we view phone numbers in the GUI...
* gui: figure out how to handle multiple entities:
      tree...?
      tree embedded in table cell?
	  file explorer style en reverso (table on left, tree on right while file explorer is tree on left, table on right)
      multiple expando-records embedded in a table cell...
* gui: add search/sort functionality
* gui: add table to main window, load with first 100...
* daemon: add slow/fast download windows

* Add In Unit Tests via "gtest"...
  [x]-Added some unit tests for "JUtils"...how about one for EdgarForms...even if it's
  as simple as reading a file and comparing to a static object.

* [x] Add in MongoDbClient::command()...this appears to be the easiest way to
   do sort().skip().limit()...(also seems to be the only way to get the 
   new automatically generated _id(), if we need it...)

Looks like the find() command is now supported in mongoc!


Extra Credit:
1. use log4cxx rather than JDA::Logger...?
